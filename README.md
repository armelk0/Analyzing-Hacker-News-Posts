# Exploring Hacker News Posts

As we keep progressing in our learning journey, this project will showcase our progression from the fundamentals to now gaining more intermediate skills like working with dates and time in python, cleaning and preparing data, object oriented programming in python, etc

In this project, we are going to analyze data from the website Hacker News which is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator where user-submitted stories (known as “posts”) are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. The original dataset in this project can be found here. However, it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximatly 20,000 by removing all submissions that did not receive any comment, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.
